Feature: User Logins
**As a registered user I would like to be able to login so I may be able to have a customized experience.**

This feature ensures that users who have previously registered can successfully login and see a personalized message
that confirms they are recognized by the application and logged in.  It also *defines* a set of seeded users for 
future software test engineers to use when performing other kinds of tests.

The steps we define here can be re-used when testing the *register* feature.

To generate living documentation, create a Documentation folder and then run one of these from the project dir:

    `livingdoc feature-folder -t bin\Debug\net7.0\TestExecution.json -o Documentation .`
